## Read queue.c, queue.h, synch.h, synch.c, include/lab2-api.h and answer the following questions

## Q1. How many semaphores and locks are available in DLXOS, respectively?

## A1. According to synch.h, DLXOS has 32 semaphores and 64 locks

## Q2. What are the system calls to create, acquire and release a lock?

## A2. The system calls to create, acquire, and release a lock are as follows:
## ## ## ANDREW, PLEASE REVIEW THIS -- WORDING CONFUSES ME. It wants to know about SYSTEM CALLS to create, acquire, and release a lock?????
## ## ## I'd wager money that the following answer isn't what the professor wants.
##     In LockCreate(), DisableIntrs() and RestoreIntrs() are called.
##     In LockAcquire(), DisableIntrs(), RestoreIntrs(), and GetCurrentPid() are called.
##     In LockRelease(), DisableIntrs(), RestoreIntrs, GetCurrentPid(), and ProcessWakeup().
## ## ## ANDREW, PLEASE REVIEW THIS -- WORDING CONFUSES ME. It wants to know about SYSTEM CALLS to create, acquire, and release a lock?????

## Q3. How is a semaphore created in DLXOS?

## A3. In synch.c, SemCreate() disables the interrupts in order to make the operation atomic.
##     SemCreate() then initializes the semaphore by calling SemInit().
##     SemInit() initializes a queue for the semaphore, which consists of setting the following values:
##     q->first = NULL; q->last = NULL; q->nitems = 0
##     If a semaphore is not currently in use, then the value is changed so that the semaphore becomes used.
##     SemInit() then returns. SemCreate() restores interrupts, and returns the handle to the semaphore
##     (for future accesses to the semaphore) if all operations were successful.
##
##     Although there are other functions dealing with semaphores (SemWait, SemHandleWait, semSignal, etc.),
##     the above conludes the process for how a semaphore is created in DLXOS.



## Q4. Explain how lock_acquire, lock_release, sem_signal and sem_wait work.

## A4. lock_acquire traps to 0x454, lock_release traps to 0x455, sem_signal traps to 0x452, and sem_wait traps to 0x451.
       These trap routines are handled by usertraps.s and traps.c.
       The handle for the item being trapped is saved into the current PCB.
       The handle will be explained more in Q5.

## Q5. What is a handle and how is it used to access semaphores in DLXOS?

## A5. The handle is a status showing whether or not a process was able to successfully obtain a semaphore.
##     We can see in os/traps.c that there are functions that set things such as "handle = SemHandleWait(ihandle);".
##     For the specific purposes of accessing semaphores, the first thing that is done is that the program ensures it is in system mode (as opposed to user mode).
##     ihandle is the argument list / the trap argument.
##     As can be seen in the file os/synch.c, in the case of SemHandleWait(ihandle), the program checks three conditions and returns a failure if any of the three conditions are true:
##     1. if the variable sem < 0
##     2. if the variable sem >= the variable MAX_SEMS
##     3. if sem[sem] is already being used
##     If none of these three conditions is true, then the program returns SYNC_SUCCESS (defined to be 1).
##     Otherwise, if any of the three conditions is true, the program returns SYNC_FAIL (defined to be 0).
##
##     For SemWait, the program disables interrupts, checks to see if the semaphore counter is <= 0, and puts the process to sleep if it is.
##     Assuming the semaphore counter is not <= 0, the semaphore counter is decremented, and interrupts are restored.
##
##     For SemSignal, the program disables interrupts and increments the semaphore counter.
##     After SemSignal increments the semaphore counter, if the semaphore counter is greater than 0, the program checks to see if a program needs to be woken up.
##     If a program does need indeed need to be woken up, the semaphore counter is decremented (in addition to the program being woken up).
##     The interrupts are then enables again.
##
##     The status (either SYNC_SUCCESS or SYNC_FAIL) is saved into the currentSavedFrame of the PCB.

## Q1. How many semaphores and locks are available in DLXOS, respectively?

## A1. According to synch.h, DLXOS has 32 semaphores and 64 locks

## Q2. What are the system calls to create, acquire and release a lock?

## A2.

## Q3. How is a semaphore created in DLXOS?

## A3. In synch.c, SemCreate() disables the interrupts in order to make the operation atomic.
##     SemCreate() then initializes the semaphore by calling SemInit().
##     SemInit() initializes a queue for the semaphore, which consists of setting the following values:
##     q->first = NULL; q->last = NULL; q->nitems = 0
##     If a semaphore is not currently in use, then the value is changed so that the semaphore becomes used.
##     SemInit() then returns. SemCreate() restores interrupts, and returns the handle to the semaphore
##     (for future accesses to the semaphore) if all operations were successful.
##
##     Although there are other functions dealing with semaphores (SemWait, SemHandleWait, semSignal, etc.),
##     the above conludes the process for how a semaphore is created in DLXOS.



## Q4. Explain how lock_acquire, lock_release, sem_signal and sem_wait work.

## A4.

## Q5. What is a handle and how is it used to access semaphores in DLXOS?

## A5.
